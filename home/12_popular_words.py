"""In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words in the text.

At the input of your function are given 2 arguments: the text and the array of words the popularity of which you need
to determine.
When solving this task pay attention to the following points:

The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like
"one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value."""
