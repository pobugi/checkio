"""Whatâ€™s your favourite day of the week? Check if it's the most common day of the week in a year.

You are given a year as an integer (e. g. 2001). You should return the most frequent day(s) of 
the week in that particular year. The result has to be a list of days sorted by the order of days 
in a week (e. g. ['Monday', 'Tuesday']). Week starts with Monday.
